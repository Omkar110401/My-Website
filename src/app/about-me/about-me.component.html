                <p>I am an accomplished IT student with a strong focus on application development and a diverse skill
                    set. My experience lies in working with Spring Framework, Spring Boot, and RESTful services, where I
                    have successfully fixed existing bugs and optimized code for enhanced performance. I have a solid
                    understanding of backend development using technologies such as C/C++, Java and Python, and I have
                    worked with databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.
                    I have also gained experience in frontend development by exploring the Angular framework and
                    successfully handling component bugs and version upgrades. Alongside HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I
                    have implemented test-driven development practices to ensure the reliability and quality of the
                    developed components.
                    In addition to my technical skills, I actively engage in code reviews, participate in technical
                    discussions, and collaborate with senior team members for continuous improvement. I am familiar with
                    version control systems like BitBucket and GitHub.
                    Apart from my academic pursuits, I have completed various certifications in Python programming,
                    JavaScript, algorithms, and data analytics. Along with the technical aspect I have explored the
                    field of Project Management through courses and certifications. These certifications have provided
                    me with a comprehensive understanding of these technologies and have strengthened my problem-solving
                    abilities</p>
